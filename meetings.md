# Meetings

## 30 Sep 2022

First intro meeting
Discussion points pre-meeting:
* What day to meet?
* Scope of the project?
* Task management tool: is Trello okay?
* Many models already trained, what else can be contributed model training-wise? (discuss research opportunities mentioned in *Oliveira et al.*)
* Programming language for model-training: Python?
* The tool itself (after the model's been trained): website? Input: **URL** (more usable but might be biased towards/against websites) or **text input** (less usable but more focused on the content)?
